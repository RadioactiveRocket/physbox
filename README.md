Contains many features, including 20+ elements, play, pause and forward buttons as well as controls to change the shape and size of the brush and take a screenshot.

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT ⚠️
Setting the render mode to glow is **NOT** reccomended as of this version as the game will run very slowly - especially when running the game on a browser other than Chrome.
